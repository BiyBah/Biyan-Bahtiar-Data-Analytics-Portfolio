### Insights
- Based on NPS score, average of users that want to promote our services only 30% which it can be said that our users aren't satisfied with services.
- The highest % leads drop is after the discussion is finished. However, based on total number, leads drop-out mostly after initial communication is success.
- Leads mostly don't state their reason on why they drop out. Most common reason of leads dropping is because they aren't interested on the product. The 2nd most common reason is price not fit.
- Industry that complains price not fit the most is F&B, followed by Education and Tech.

### Recommendation
- Offer customization options or negotiate pricing.
- Enhance response time. One way to do it is by reducing funnel step.
