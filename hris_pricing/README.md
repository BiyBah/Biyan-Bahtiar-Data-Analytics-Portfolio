## Problem:
Why customer growth is decreasing in 2022 especially for business subscription type to 44,59%

## Objective:
- To know what is the cause of decreasing growth.
- To increase business subscription customer growth to at least 60%.
- To calculate price elasticity of demand and do impact analysis.

## Method:
### Root cause analysis
Decreasing growth is probably caused by price problem or leads found better product. Price problem is probably caused by high operational cost or not enough discount.

### Exploratory Data Analysis Insights
- People are more attracted to subscribe on discount month in 2022. Total customer subscribing using discount is 298 and without discount is 256.
- Business subscription type growth is the lowest in 44,6%, while startup and enterprise is 58% and 89,3% respectively.
- Unit Economics is up to standard in 2022 (standard is >3.0, while company performance is 3,514). This indicates that marketing spend is efficient.

### Pricing Strategy Analysis
- Before we calculate PED, we cluster the customer based on number of employee, since what customer paid to company is also based on number of employee, aside from subscription type.
- In short, business subscription type can be given discount 40% for number of employee <100 and 45% for number of employee <225.

### Impact Analysis
- By giving said discount, all things equal to 2022, it is estimated that business subscription type customer will grow to 93,91%, passing the target of 60%. This already accounts both total new customer on discount month and non-discount month.
